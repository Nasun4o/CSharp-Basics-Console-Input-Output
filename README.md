r	perimeter	area
2	12.57	12.57
3.5	21.99	38.48

Problem 4.	Number Comparer
Write a program that gets two numbers from the console and prints the greater of them. Try to implement this without if statements. Examples:
a	b	greater
5	6	6
10	5	10
0	0	0
-5	-2	-2
1.5	1.6	1.6

Problem 5.	Formatting Numbers
Write a program that reads 3 numbers: an integer a (0 ≤ a ≤ 500), a floating-point b and a floating-point c and prints them in 4 virtual columns on the console. Each column should have a width of 10 characters. The number a should be printed in hexadecimal, left aligned; then the number a should be printed in binary form, padded with zeroes, then the number b should be printed with 2 digits after the decimal point, right aligned; the number c should be printed with 3 digits after the decimal point, left aligned. Examples:
a	b	c	result
254	11.6	0.5	|FE        |0011111110|      11.6|0.500     |
499	-0.5559	10000	|1F3       |0111110011|     -0.56|10000.000 |
0	3	-0.1234	|0         |0000000000|         3|-0.123    |
